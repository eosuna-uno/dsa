### Stack

A Stack is a LIFO - Last in first out, there's more than 1 way to implement it
we're gonna use an [array first](./stack_array.ts),
then a [link list](./link_list_stack.ts)


Is usually use in function invocations (stacking the functions to know which one goes next),
undo/redo operations, routing and much more.

And Stacks are not a built-in data structure in JS

### Queue
A Queue differ from a stack in that is not a LIFO is FIFO - First in, First Out.
USES:
- Background tasks
- Uploading Resources
- Printing  / Task Processing
